Read data into R as:
library(foreign)
data <- read.dta('file.dta')

heights.dta:
Data file from example in Gelman and Hill's Data Analysis using Regression and Mutlilevel/Hierarchical Models
no apparent meta data, but the book describes the data as from a 1994 survey of adult Americans, and used in the book for regressions of earnings on height.
The meaning of the codings for various variables should be inferrable from knowing a bit about US demographics - I can help with this if needed.

2004_labeled_processed_race.dta:
Data used in Gelman's article, 
[2007] Rich state, poor state, red state, blue state: What's the matter with Connecticut? {\em Quarterly Journal of Political Science} {\bf 2}, 345--367. (Andrew Gelman, Boris Shor, Joseph Bafumi, and David Park)

exit poll data from the 2004 election. Again the meaning of the codings for various variables should be inferrable from knowing a bit about US demographics - I can help with this if needed.

Note that the heights data have some continuous variables but the election data are all categorical.

stateIncome.txt is extracted from http://www.census.gov/compendia/databooks/2010/tables/sma_A-33.xls and provides average income by state based on data for 2005-2007.
