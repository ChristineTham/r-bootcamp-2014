# The R way

Note to BB: remember to start recording.

As we've seen R is powerful, flexible, and wide-ranging. 

It's also sprawling, disorganized, and use-at-your-own risk. 

Base packages, widely-used packages and packages by frequent R contributors are more trustworthy. 

# Some of the 'features' of R

* R is inconsistent in its naming conventions
    - Some functions are 'camelCase'; others are 'dot.separated'; others 'use_underscores'. For programmers used to OOP, the use of dots is maddening.
  * Multiple OOP paradigms and OOP is not as clean or full-featured as other languages
  * R has multiple graphics packages that different functions use for default plot construction (`base`, `grid`, `lattice`, and `ggplot2`)
  * R has multiple packages and functions to do the same analysis
  * R obscures some of what happens behind the scenes in a way that can be confusing and lead to errors: type coercion/casting, recycling, etc.

Any other things that you found frustrating and don't think are well-designed?


# R tutorials and materials

Some of this material was borrowed/modified from [Jared Knowles' bootcamp](http://jaredknowles.com/r-bootcamp/)

CRAN has [manuals](http://www.cran.r-project.org/manuals.html) and [contributed learning material](http://www.cran.r-project.org/other-docs.html).

[D-Lab](dlab.berkeley.edu) holds workshops on R and other topics, as well as having drop-in office hours.
